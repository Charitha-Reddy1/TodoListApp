# TodoListApp
A basic full-stack single web page project to add,toggle and delete the todo tasks..
Entire development from project setup, defining the model and repository layers, writing service and controller logic, to crafting the templates and frontend interactions. You’ll see me implement add, toggle (mark task complete/incomplete), and delete functionalities.


It was incredibly rewarding to see the entire Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture come together, integrating everything from the Java controller logic and entity mapping right down to the polished HTML templates.
This project perfectly solidified my understanding of full-stack development workflows and backend-to-frontend integration! 💡
